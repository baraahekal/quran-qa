# TCE at Quran QA 2022 & 2023
This repo contains the code submissions for both subtasks of the Quran QA competitions held in 2022 and 2023.

I led the Tanta Computer Engineering (TCE) team for two consecutive years and through our collective efforts,
we successfully achieved first place in both editions of the competition ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥‡.

All models can be found on my [huggingface account](https://huggingface.co/MatMulMan)
